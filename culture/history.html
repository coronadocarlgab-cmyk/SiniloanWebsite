      <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
      <p>
 From the early period of Spanish colonialisation, some female inhabitants of the place were milling their crops in their fields. 
 While doing this, some Spaniards came and asked them, “Como se llama esta pueblo?” 
 The natives not knowing Spanish thought they were asked what they were doing and one of them answered, 
 “camí po ay gumiguiling”. The Spaniards repreated, “Guiling-Guiling”, to which the natives nodded. 
 Some know the place Siniloan as “Guiling-Guiling”  from 1583 to 1604

      <h3>Juan Puno, Juan Pili, Juan Puhuwan</h3>
      <p>
    Another story has it that during the later part of the year 1604, three brothers, namely Juan Puno, Juan Pili, and Juan Puhuwan, migrated into this community. 
    They selected a lot adjacent to the river Río Romelo and divided it equally among themselves. 
    When the parish priest saw the ingenuity of the three brothers in equally dividing the land, he asked the natives how equally was expressed in Tagalog. 
    The natives gave him the expression “Siniloan”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right then and there, the name “Guiling-Guiling” was changed to Siniloang which meant justice, equality, and fairness. 
        The word travelled from mouth to mouth with sound variations. 
        Because of the difficulty of some Spaniards in pronouncing Siniloang, the name Siniloan struck and became the official name of the town.

      <h3>Luis and Ana</h3>
      <p>
     The name Siniloan is also believed to have been taken from a legendary story about Luis and Ana, a married couple who chased a wild boar from a place called  Luisiana. 
     They ran after that big boar from Luisiana to Cavinti (kapit sa Binti). 
     The people along the way who saw Luis and Ana chasing the boar took pity on them and helped them to catch it. 
     The people chased the boar through the towns of Lumbán, Kalayaan, Loñgos, Paéte, Paquil, and Pañguil until they finally caught the boar in this town by means of the lassoed captivity or Siniloan. Siniloan start on 3 eggs.

      <h3>Siniloan</h3>
      <p>
    In 1583, Siniloan came to be as a town. This was the year when Don Juan de Salcedo came to this place and the parish was established jointly by Friar Diégo de Orpesa and Friar Juan de Plasencia. 
    The first stone church was erected in 1733 by a Franciscan Friar, Fr. Melchor de San Antonio. 
    The towns of Santa Maria (formerly Caboan) and Mabitac, also former visitas or barrios of Sinilóan, were separated from the town in 1602 and 1613, respectively. 
    Calumpang, a barrio later known as the town of Famy, was separated from the town two centuries later.
      </p>
      <p>
    In 1903, Famy and Pangil were consolidated with Siniloan. 
    In 1910, Famy separated to become a town once again. Pangil was also separated.
